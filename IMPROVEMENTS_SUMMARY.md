# Travel Agent Improvements Summary

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

Based on the user's requirements, the following issues have been successfully resolved:

### 1. ✅ 热门景点没有配图 (Missing attraction images)
**Problem**: HTML showed placeholder gradients instead of real images
**Solution**: 
- Enhanced `AttractionService` to integrate with `ImageHandler`
- Added image fetching using Unsplash API
- Added search keywords for better image matching
- Updated HTML template to display real images when available

### 2. ✅ 缺少交通规划 (Missing transportation planning)
**Problem**: No comprehensive transportation options
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `TravelPlannerAgent._plan_transportation()` with three main options:
  - **自驾 (Self-driving)**: Route planning, fuel costs, tolls, parking
  - **高铁 (High-speed rail)**: Schedules, booking info, seat types
  - **飞机 (Airplane)**: Flight options, airports, baggage policies
- Added detailed pros/cons, booking information, and practical tips
- Added transportation section to HTML template
- Integrated recommendations based on budget preferences

### 3. ✅ 日期处理问题 (Date parsing issues)
**Problem**: No handling of relative dates like "今天", "明天", "后天"
**Solution**:
- Added `parse_date_input()` method to `TravelPlannerAgent`
- Dynamic system date parsing using `datetime.now()`
- Support for multiple date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY/MM/DD, etc.)
- Validation to prevent past dates
- Chinese relative date mappings:
  - "今天" → current system date
  - "明天" → next day
  - "后天" → day after tomorrow

### 4. ✅ 天气预报不准确 (Inaccurate weather forecast)
**Problem**: Weather data was mock/placeholder
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `WeatherService` with multiple city name variations
- Improved Chinese city name handling with Pinyin conversion
- Added city mapping for common Chinese cities (西安 → Xi'an, Xian, etc.)
- Enhanced mock weather with seasonal patterns when API fails
- Better error handling and fallback mechanisms
